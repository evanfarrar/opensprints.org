Textpattern 4.0.8

Released under the Gnu General Public License

== Installation ==

* Extract the files to your site (in the web root, or choose a
  subdirectory). The top-level index.php should reside in this
  directory, as should the /textpattern/ and the /rpc/ directory.
* Create, or establish the existence of, a working mysql database,
  load /textpattern/setup/ (or /subpath/textpattern/setup/ )
  in a browser, and follow the directions.

== Upgrading ==

* Simply replace the two files in your main installation directory
  (index.php and .htaccess), everything in your /rpc/ directory and
  everything in your /textpattern/ directory (except config.php)
  with the corresponding files in this distribution.
* When you login to the admin-side, the relevant upgrade script is
  run automatically. Please take a look into diagnostics to find out
  whether there are any errors and whether the correct version number
  is displayed.
