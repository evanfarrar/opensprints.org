LANGUAGE FILES

All language strings used by Textpattern are stored in the database 
as of 1.0RC4 (and later). You can change your language by selecting from 
the installed languages in "admin -> preferences". To install additional 
languages, go to "admin -> preferences -> Install Language". The 
preferred and default method of installation is to query a remote server 
(at textpattern.com) to ensure that you always get the most recent 
set of languages in their most recent state.

In case your computer is not connected to the Internet, the fallback method
is to install from the files that are in the /textpattern/lang directory. 
Please be aware that these files may be outdated and newer language strings 
may be missing. 

If you are interested in translating Textpattern into your own language, we
would like to hear from you on our forums at http://www.textpattern.com/.
